  Experience<br/>
  <br/>
  In August 2015, I started working at a top dental management agency called Dentonic where I worked as a full-time PHP developer for 8 months.
  <br/>
  But, looking to improve my skills to the next level I had to make the hard decision to leave Dentonic and look for a new opportunity. In September 2017 I joined 'ibulud', another web agency which uses Laravel as a daily tool/framework.
  <br/>
  And besides that, I started moving to a part-time freelancer part-time employee schedule. I quickly had more demand than time available for new projects.
  <br/>
  I've been working on various projects as a freelancer, on small to big teams.
  <br/>
  In September 2018 I started to work with sarir computer but it didn't last long and after to month in November 2018 I started to work with TGBSCo a web and mobile application agency. I in part of three main products of this company winigames, digital marketing, and kholase audiobooks.
